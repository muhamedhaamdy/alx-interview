# 0x06. Star Wars API

## Description

This project involves interacting with the Star Wars API to retrieve information about various Star Wars films and characters. You'll learn how to make HTTP requests in Node.js, handle asynchronous operations, and parse JSON data.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to make HTTP requests in Node.js
- Work with Promises and async/await for handling asynchronous operations
- Parse and manipulate JSON data
- Extract and display specific information from API responses

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript
- Familiarity with Node.js
- Understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript (callbacks, Promises, async/await)

## Setup

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a Project Directory**: Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

    ```sh
    mkdir star-wars-api
    cd star-wars-api
    ```

3. **Initialize a Node.js Project**: Initialize a new Node.js project using npm.

    ```sh
    npm init -y
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies. For this project, we'll use the `request` library for making HTTP requests.

    ```sh
    npm install request
    ```
